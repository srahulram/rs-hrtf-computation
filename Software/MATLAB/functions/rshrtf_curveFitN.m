function N = rshrtf_curveFitN(mu,a,b,c)
%CURVEFITN Curve to fit data for N versus mu.
%   N = CURVEFITN(MU,A,B,C) takes MU data and computes N using the
%   specified model with parameters A, B, and C. 
%
%   This function is useful when working with the cftool GUI. It is not
%   called by any of the existing scripts.
